      <h1>Work with me</h1>

      <p style={{ fontSize: 16 }}>I am actively seeking motivated and creative students and researchers to work with me in the exciting landscape of <em className='text-hl'>Data Visualization</em>, <em className='text-hl'>Human-AI Interactions</em>, and <em className='text-hl'>Data Science</em>. Before reaching out, please have a careful look at my research mission and selected publications to ensure our research interests align. I also highly value students who bring their own ideas, enthusiasm, and passion in these fields. </p>

      <h3>What I Expect:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Passion and curiosity</b> are essential for embarking on the exciting journey of research, whether it's for designing beautiful content, telling impressive stories, or crafting tools you want to use. The ability to cope with uncertainty, writing, reading, presentation and communication skills are essential. While you don’t need to master all skills at the start, my role is to help you develop them into strengths. I look for signs of potential to grow in these areas.</li>
        <li><b>Technical capabilities</b> to develop visualizations (e.g., to know d3.js) and user interfaces (e.g., TypeScript, front-end frameworks like Vue/React) are encouraged. Prior knowledge in data visualization, experiment design, and statistical analysis could be a bonus in your application. A solid foundation (e.g., from related majors such as computer science, electronic computing, and media technology) and a willingness to learn are key—skills not yet mastered can be definitely developed during the course of your study.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>For PhD Applications:</h3>
      <p>I am currently <b className='text-hl'>offering funded PhD student positions</b> all year around. You can find more information about <a className='text-hl' href='https://www.ncl.ac.uk/postgraduate/degrees/8050f-23' target='_blank'>the PhD program</a> at School of Computing, Newcastle University.</p>

      <p>You are encouraged to explore <a className="text-hl" href="./img/projects.pdf" target='_blank'>my proposed projects</a> and <a className="text-hl" href="https://shuxinhuan.github.io/#publication">past publications</a> to find inspiration. I'd also love to talk to students with their own ideas that align with both research interests. If you are interested, please reach out via <a className='text-hl' href="mailto:xinhuan.shu@newcastle.ac.uk">email</a> with the title to be <code className='hl'>Prospective PhD-[Current Position]-[Institute/Organization]</code>. I encourage you to briefly describe your motivation for applying and your first thoughts on the project you would be interested in working on (either something I am working on or a topic of your choice). Also, attach your resume, and related research experience. </p> 

      Keep in mind that funding is extremely competitive and any funding thought by the student will help the process. There are some other funding opportunities within the University.

      <h3>For Undergraduate / Master Students:</h3>
      I am currently supervising multiple undergraduate and master's dissertation projects within the School of Computing. If you are interested in undertaking a dissertation under my supervision, I encourage you to review the <a className='text-hl' href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/14CZoO7SpJMaVXLBX9U3rtiLfnMmtDN97ad69k36W_tM/edit?usp=sharing' target='_blank'>proposed projects</a> to explore potential ideas.

      <h3>Important remarks:</h3>
      <p>I greatly appreciate a thoughtful and personalized email explaining your research interests and how we can find common interests. If your email appears generic or suggests a lack of familiarity with my research, you may probably not get a response. </p>
