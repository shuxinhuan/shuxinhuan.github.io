          I am currently a PostDoc Fellow, advised by <a className="hl" href="https://vishub.net/bach">Prof. Benjamin Bach</a> in <a className="hl" href="https://vishub.net/">VisHub</a> at Univeristy of Edinburgh.
          I'm also an incoming lecturer (assistant professor) in the <a className="hl" href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/">School of Computing, Newcastle University</a> in 2024 Spring.
          I am actively seeking motivated PhD students and research interns! ðŸ™Œ

          My research aims to <span className="text-hl">engage humans in interacting with the world of data through visualization</span>. I work on developing expressive visualization techniques and intelligent tools that enable <b>human-data interaction</b> at various data activities, such as data transformation, analysis, communication, and decision-making.
          {/* My reserach mainly adopts qualitative methods and miexed methods.
          Methodology wise I use qualitative methods as my main method, including interviews and content analysis. I also use mixed methods adding descriptive and inferential statistics as needed.
          My research probes the intersection of <b>data visualization</b> and <b>human-computer interaction</b>, where I aim to explore innovative approaches to <b>facilitate human-data interaction</b>. Specifically, I conduct user studies to understand how humans perceive and apply visual designs and interactions in data-driven communication and decision-making. Further, I design and develop interactive and automatic tools for both novices and experts to ease the creation of data visualizations, paving the way for data democratization. */}
